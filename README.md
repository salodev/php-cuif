# php-cuif
Console User Intefrace Framework for PHP

repo maintenance now is under https://github.com/salojc2006/cuif

My idea is get a easy way to make interactive console programs, with visual objects such windows, textboxes, grids, but no messing with code to get it.

see prueba.php code for examples.
